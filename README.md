# MyLogiSim
Unfortunately, my wires are iffy. The wire button creates a line between the two previous touched locations. 
Since I was unable to figure out how to retrieve two different image locations, for the wiring to work, one location must be an element while the other must be a touch on the screen
(not directly on the element; may be beside an image or else the line will be drawn from the last screen touch). In addition, I cannot save, delete, nor run/pause my program yet.
